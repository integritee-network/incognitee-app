# Incognitee App

This repository contains the sources for the Incognitee app statically deployed on [try.incognitee.io](https://try.incognitee.io) for Testnets and [app.incognitee.io](https://app.incognitee.io) for production.

## Note

The `@encointer/worker-api` uses the browser's built-in `webcrypto` api. This library is only available in secure
secure contexts. Hence, in local development you must use `localhost`. `webcrypto` is undefined on `127.0.0.1` and
`0.0.0.0`.

## Configuration

This dapp uses `.env` to configure deployment settings like default networks and endpoints.

### local testing

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and set your preferences

```
SHIELDING_TARGET=PaseoRelay
INCOGNITEE_SIDECHAIN=IncogniteePaseoRelay
INTEGRITEE_NETWORK=IntegriteePaseo
SHARD=5wePd1LYa5M49ghwgZXs55cepKbJKhj5xfzQGfPeMS7c
SHIELDING_LIMIT=50
LIVE=true
```

### try.incognitee.io

For testnets, GH actions will automatically use the `.env.testnet` file to deploy the app.

### app.incognitee.io

For production, GH actions will automatically use the `.env.production` file to deploy the app.
